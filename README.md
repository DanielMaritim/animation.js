# animation.js

a simple animation in JavaScript.Well still trying to learn JS

JavaScript animations are done by programming gradual changes in an element's style.

SplitText is an easy to use JavaScript utility that allows you to split HTML text into characters, It also wraps each word in its own span, so you can target them individually too. it wraps each character not excluding whitespace characters in a <span> tag and adding various attributes that allow you to more easily target and manipulate each one.

The changes are called by a timer. When the timer interval is small, the animation looks continuous.
