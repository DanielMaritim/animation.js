a simple animation in JavaScript.Well still trying to learn JS

JavaScript animations are done by programming gradual changes in an element's style.

SplitText is an easy to use JavaScript utility that allows you to split HTML text into characters

The changes are called by a timer. When the timer interval is small, the animation looks continuous.
